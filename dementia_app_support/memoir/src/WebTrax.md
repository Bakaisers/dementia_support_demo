I now had to set up a company, work out how to do the finances, get development machines and an Internet connection.

But the first thing you need to do when setting up your own company is find a good name! I'm not very creative as anyone will tell you, so it was always going to be a 'functional' name. Even at that early time in the Web, I had trouble finding a name that was different and appropriate. 

I went through lists and lists of names, and typically just when I thought I had a good one, I would find that there was a big company in the US with the same name. A real drag.
