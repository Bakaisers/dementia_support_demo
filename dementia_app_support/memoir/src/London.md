## Overseas, London based
I must have still been seeing Julie socially, and mentioned my thoughts on going overseas. She said she had wanted to do something similar, but as a holiday, not a change of life thing. She had to continue teaching, and had long-service leave coming up. That gave her about 8 weeks to spend on the trip. She was also much happier about travelling with someone she trusted as a friend. 

We started planning the big trip. It involved starting with a cruise ship from Aus to Singapore, followed by a cut-price flight from Singapore to London.
