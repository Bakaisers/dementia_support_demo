# Intro
Hi, I am, or was, depending on when you read this, Peter Twerp, born 1/2/1931 in Adelaide.

And that's the last time you will see a potentially ambiguous date written in this book. I was born 1931-01-02. Totally unambiguous, whether you are Australian, American, or any other species.

## Purpose
What to expect from this book. Basically a succinct (hopefully) history of my life, plus my thoughts on the whole 'life' thing. 

I'm someone who has not kept diaries regularly during my life (and most of them were event based or work diaries, not personal). I've had to use my memory (not good at the best of times) and then pick up memory joggers from my work diaries, or photo collections as prompts as to what I was doing at various times during my life.
