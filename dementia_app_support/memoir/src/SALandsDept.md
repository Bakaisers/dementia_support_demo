## SA Lands Dept

### Land Ownership and Title System (LOTS)
My first job after graduating from the Computer Studies degree, was with the SA Lands Department. 

I wasn't too sure where I wanted to go, but I was confident that my knowledge and skills learnt doing the degree had made me very 'employable'. Jobs were fairly plentiful, even though SA was a small state, so had limited companies doing big IT jobs.
