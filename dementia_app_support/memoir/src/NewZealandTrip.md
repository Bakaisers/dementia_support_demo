# New Zealand trip

This was one of those "you sure can pick'em" trips. 

We flew direct to Wellington on the ?? and spent ?? days travelling around the North Island sight-seeing.

TBC??

On the 13th we decided to book into a hotel near the ferry terminal, so that we could drop off the hire car and get straight on the ferry.

## The Kaikoura Earthquake

I'll just give you the 'highlight' of the trip, the massive earthquake that hit the South Island on 2016-11-14 at 2 minutes past midnight, centred around Kaikoura, about 100k from the top of the South Island. 

It registered 7.8 on the scale, and according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Kaik%C5%8Dura_earthquake) was the "most complex earthquake ever studied".

And we were on the top floor of a 10 story high-rise building!

Jacki and I had just booked a 2 night stay at Kaikoura which was a convenient distance down into the South Island, and hopped into bed about 10:30pm. We were woken must after midnight by solid vibrations in the bed. 

The bed was slotted into an alcove between the bathroom and the outside wall window with a panoramic view of the other high-rise buildings in Wellington.

I happened to be on the window side, and recognised it as an earthquake fairly quickly. Both Jacki and I had been through a much smaller one in Cupertino some years before. 

I slid out the bed and sat on the floor between the bed and the wall. The window came down to about 400mm off the floor level, so we could still see directly out into the darkness. 

Jacki tried to walk around the bed to my side, and couldn't stand up without overbalancing. I told her to crawl around, which she did. 

By this time, the random shaking of the building had consolidated into a strong sway in the direction we were looking out the window. It was a weird experience, as you had no idea how much the building was flexing, but you could tell it was a good number of seconds between reaching one extreme and swaying back to the other extreme. 

It felt, and it may have just been my imagination, that each sway was getting a bit longer. All we could see was pitch black with lots of building and street lights in the distance. No way to judge the distance. 

Neither of us panicked, but mentally I was wondering how far these 'earthquake proof' buildings could bend before breaking. There was no point in worrying, if it went we were dead as a dodo. 

After 2 minutes (that felt like a lot longer) it slowly stopped swaying. A message came over the announcement system, to hold our places until further notice. 

Eventually we were cleared to exit our rooms, and descend down the stairs. This is when I found out how far these buildings can bend. The vertical plaster-board sheeting in the stairwell had tape that covered over the joins between each panel. Well from about the 4th floor up, the building had flexed that much that it tore the masking tape longitunally. That's some flexing.

I had only chucked on a few clothes that were handy as I left, and we had to congregate in the street outside the hotel. It was a very cold night, so I was suffering, but I was better off than those who just ran out in their night attire. This is when I discovered the real benefit of mainly useless social media. Various people had looked up Twitter as soon as they got out, and were telling us exactly where the epicentre was, and various updates as they happened. 

The staff were very good. It took them sometime to sweep the whole building to ensure everyone was out. Several people came out later very sheepishly, having slept right through the earthquake and the announcements! The staff then found various items that people could use to keep them warmer.

We had to wait outside for over an hour, while they checked the basic structure of the building to ensure it was safe. I'd say that was fairly self-evident, as it survived the earthquake, and from the outside there was no apparent damage, not even cracked windows. 

Eventually we were given the all-clear to go back into the hotel. And we could either go back to our rooms, or if we weren't comfortable doing that, we could have a makeshift bed in the main foyer. I think most went back to their rooms, we did.

Going to sleep was another matter though. There had been a number of aftershocks while we were outside which hadn't worried us much, but it seemed to be inevitable that just as you were about to get to sleep another aftershock would come through, and you would be wide awake again. I think I got to sleep about 4 am. 

The next morning we heard that the ferry terminal pedestrian landing had been damaged, and they were only taking vehicles on-board, but then even that was cancelled as the ferry terminal on the South Island also had serious damage.

We headed into town to get some food and drink. It was a bit spooky. All staff had basically been ordered not to come to work that day, there was no transport except your own vehicle, and all buildings were closed with rare exceptions. Also, a lot of the buildings had large numbers of cracked windows that had showered down onto the road and footpaths. 

This all presented a problem for us as we were looking for a public toilet, as you do. We tried everyone we could find on our maps, and all were completely locked up. There were no coffee shops etc open, so we couldn't even get to one there. I was beginning to think this was going to get embarrassing soon, but we found, by sheer luck, a cafe that had opened (I presume the owners lived in the building) and was serving nice breakfasts, and had a clean toilet. Salvation!

The good news was that there were very little major structural damage to buildings in Wellington, but it was very obvious that we were not going to make it to the South Island. One of the main carparks had structural damage in several of its main pylons (and this was meant to be a recent earthquake proof building). The main damage was windows, glaziers must have been rubbing their hands with glee.

We called into the hire car company CBD office, just as the employees were walking out, as they had been told to get out due to worries about the building. We just had time to ask them what we should do about the car, and their response was "Do what you like, we don't care. We have thousands of cars stranded across NZ". We decided we would continue to explore more of the North Island, so we extended our hire, and booked back into the B&B that we had originally been in. 

## Back to normality, or NZ normality anyway!
