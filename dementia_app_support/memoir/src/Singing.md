## Singing when young
As a youngster I joined the church choir, mainly to get out of religious instruction which younger people were required to do while their parents were in church. It was not something I enjoyed at all. I found it very 'preachy', much like the church services and didn't warm to it at all. I mean, some of the stories were good, and I probably learned some good principles of living from them, but I just didn't like the way it was presented. 

I think Mum suggested the choir, and I can remember going to the first rehearsal, and being shit scared that I wouldn't know what to do. After all these years, I can still remember one piece of instruction on the first night which was that you never pronounce heaven as 'hev-enn', it was always 'hev'n'. It has stood me in good stead many a time (joke).

I did enjoy the singing, it came naturally, and I managed to learn the hymns and psalms quite easily. As compared to now, where I battle to learn new songs.

My favourite times were when we got PAID to sing. This was normally only for weddings, which were being paid for by the couple getting married. But each year we also had a Carols night where we did the rounds of the surrounding suburbs visiting aged care places and singing to the residents. There was something very positive and lovely at those performances, and is one of the reasons why I am very happy to do them now. It is even more poignant now having lost Mum, John and Ath to dementia, to see their faces light up, even just a little as they recognise a song from their youth. 

I gave up singing in the church choir when I was about 12, as it was not something that I thought was cool, even though I enjoyed the singing. And like a lot of other things in life, I pulled out of it. To my detriment I now realise.
