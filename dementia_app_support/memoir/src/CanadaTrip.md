# Canada trip
## Part 1, East Coast
Jacki and I had thought about taking another trip oversees. We both had a preference for anglo-saxon destinations. I was getting too old to handle the hassles of different languages, currencies etc.

So we thought a trip that combined seeing Canada with catching up with Stefan Schaefer at their holiday house on Vancouver Island, or down in Cupertino, made sense.
