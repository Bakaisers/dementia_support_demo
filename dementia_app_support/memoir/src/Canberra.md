# Canberra
We had a trip down to Canberra to visit Gail, and check out the situation there. It all appeared good, the decision was made, my contract with Fairfax ended and we moved to Canberra. 

We kept the house in Gordon, and bought a little house at Kippax, in the outer suburbs of Canberra. It was relatively cheap so we figured we wouldn't lose any money on it if we had to sell in a year or two's time. That decision made life a little difficult a year later.
