# The First Age: Learning

For this section of the book I've decided to split it into 3 parts, much like the University of the Third Age does, ie the first age from birth through to the end of formal study, second age from entering the work force through to leaving the work force, and third age, that gentle time of relaxation while the rest of the world works to support you. Not!

The time frame for the first age is 1931 to 1958ish.

## Basic facts about me
I was born to parents ?? on 19??-??-??. I died on 20??-??-??. Not sure when I died, but I assume someone else will take the trouble to fill that in. 

One could say I was a 'mistake', as my 4 elder siblings were nicely spaced out 2 years apart, and I appeared 6 years after the youngest of them. I never heard if it was a deliberate mistake or not, but from my point of view it was a great mistake for them to make, and I am eternally grateful to them for being fallible. 

## Me in one paragraph
I've had a very good life, compared to the vast majority of the population of this planet. I've lived in one of the best countries in the world, in relative prosperity, through mainly peaceful times, to loving parents, grew up in a stable family, had my own stable family, good jobs, good activities. And my personal path through this life has had far more luck than misfortune, success than failure, good experiences vs bad, etc etc??

<em>And if you doubt the veracity of any of the above statements about the state of the world I urge you to read Matt Ridley's articles about how the last 30 years have been 'the best' that this planet has ever experienced. Note, not 'perfect', but 'the best'. Then objectively match up the facts against your own world view.</em>
