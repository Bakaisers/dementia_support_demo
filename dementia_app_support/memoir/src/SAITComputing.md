## SA Institute of Technology Computer Studies degree

When I decided that I needed to leave the Highways Dept job, I got hold of the application form for SAIT, and found they did a range of engineering courses that I was interested in. But you had to put down 4 choices in order of preference.

Well, I put down Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering as my first 3 choices. Which in retrospect I'm sure would have been a total disaster, just like at the Adelaide Uni. 

But I had to put down a 4th option, so I scanned the list, saw Computer Studies as an option, and thought 'why not, that should be interesting'. But really, I knew nothing about it.

I'm assuming that SAIT looked at my previous record, and probably check the Adelaide Uni results, and said "no way he's doing engineering here". So, I got a call from someone from the Computer Studies area to say I had been accepted by them. My response was something like "What's it about", to which he replied "Well its probably easier to come along and try it, than for me to explain it". He said they had an aptitude test in the first week, and I could always pull out if I didn't like it.

So, I put in my resignation with the Lands Dept, and headed off to SAIT. I ended up getting 98 or similar for the aptitude tests, and thought the initial lectures quite logical and interesting. I stayed on, and I loved it. No complicated science or mathematics, just plain logic and common sense.
