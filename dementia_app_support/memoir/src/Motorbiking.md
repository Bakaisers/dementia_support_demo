# Motorbikin'
The following sections cover my history with motorbikes. Not just the bikes, but the activities associated with them that still dwell in my memory. 

## Honda CB450
At about the time I started at Uni, early 1970, I received some money from Uncle Frank after he kindly died. It wasn't a lot, but it was enough to help me indulge my next fantasy of buying a motorcycle. 

I had no money to buy any good equipment, so I had to make do with basic clothes and gloves etc. I did have to buy a helmet, but everything else was repurposed civi clothes. One of which was my father's nice lined leather gloves (I presume) which I still have 50 years later, and use to handle wood when putting it into the fireplace. The other good bit of gear I got, was a lovely leather jacket, which I assume was also my father's. It was in pretty bad shape, very scuffed and faded, but good solid leather and lining. Mum decided to take it to ?? to be refurbished, and it came back looking beautiful, lovely soft leather, warm liner. It was a bit big for me (not hard when you're as skinny as I am) but I loved it.
