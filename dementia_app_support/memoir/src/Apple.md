## Apple Computer Canberra
Apple in Canberra did not sell computers directly, it operated to support the Apple dealers in town. At this time they were hoping to break into the 'enterprise' market using the Mac as the desktop machine to replace PCs. An ambitious goal given the price difference between the two, and the known tendency of Government departments to go for the lowest tender price for everything.

I was going in as a 'Systems Engineer', not that I had any idea what that meant. I learnt. There was little or no programming, but I was there to 'architect' the solutions we needed to pitch. And then 'sell' them technically to the potential client. 

My first issue was getting on top of the capabilities and requirements of the available Macintosh models. Which took some time, but I managed to look like I knew what I was doing, even if I didn't.
