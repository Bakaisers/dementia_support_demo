## Sydney

### James Fairfax & Sons saga
I had arranged the job with Fairfax from London. There were very few IT people in Aus with experience on Tandem Computers, so they were keen to get me back to Aus. I started on contract for 6 months, and the contract ended up being extended for about 5 years. 

### Why Tandem
One of the main reasons that Fairfax had chosen the SII publishing system was due to the awful time they had had using the current DEC mini-computer based system. Not that there was anything wrong with the hardware, but the software was being developed by a very small company in Sydney?? and was not fit for the task. 

This made them very nervous about the capabilities of the new system. They wanted everything tested before it went live, to prove that it was capable of handling the load. 

### The old publishing system
To give you an idea of how bad the old system was, when I started on the job, I noticed there were red and green lights in the ceilings of most rooms containing editorial or classified ads staff. They would randomly switch from green to red and vice versa. I just assumed they were part of the production process telling people when to do stuff. 

No, it was a warning system to tell staff that the main computer system was becoming overloaded and would probably crash in the next minute or two. And how did they fix the problem. They had a second fully operational version of the system on 'standby', being kept up-to-date by file duplication from one machine to the other. But there were always going to be articles being worked on that needed to be saved if the machine was about to die.

So they wired up one of the keys on the keyboard to effectively operate a switch to disconnect the terminal from the main machine and reconnect it to the backup machine. They could then 'save' the data direct to the backup machine. 

Once the main machine's load had reduced they could flick back to it, and resave the document to the main machine. 

It was some time before I found out that is what the lights were for, and I had trouble believing it. But even later I got to see some of the wiring in the ceilings, and it was horrendous due to the duplication of connections. It got even worse after we installed the new system as it also had to be duplicated cabling.
