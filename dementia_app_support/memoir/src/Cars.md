## Mum's FJ Holden
Mum had kept the original FJ Holden we had when we first moved to Joslin. But as the olders siblings moved out, it was used less, and at some stage it suffered the common fate for the engine in the FJ, it stripped the timing gear which in those days was not metal but made out of some composite fibre. Mainly to keep noise down I guess, but longevity was not it's forte.

I was a young teenager interested in mechanical things and wanted to fix it. But I had very limited tools. There was a hotch-potch of old tools in the garage, which by the way had a 'pit' in it. You could stand in the pit to work on the underside of the vehicle. As far as I know, the old corrugated iron garage is still there (or it was about 10 years ago when I last drove past) and probably still has the pit.

I attempted to fix the timing gear but it was a total disaster, and in the end we had to give/sell the car to a wrecker.
