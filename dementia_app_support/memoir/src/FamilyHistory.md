# Family history summary

## The Thomas line
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse a interdum odio. Nunc massa ipsum, consectetur vel mauris id, cursus elementum orci. Nam interdum pharetra lobortis. Orci varius natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. 

My paternal grandmother, ??, came from Ireland. 

Aenean tincidunt leo et leo malesuada, ac ornare augue condimentum. Proin libero magna, vehicula et quam nec, pharetra ullamcorper eros. Mauris quis neque ac diam placerat lacinia. Nam ut mollis lorem. Sed vehicula orci eu purus imperdiet, et consequat lectus sollicitudin. Sed in lorem ullamcorper, posuere sapien eget, semper mi. Praesent ornare nisl ligula, id auctor ipsum condimentum et. Nullam venenatis ipsum ligula, vitae tincidunt felis ullamcorper vitae.

The story goes that Sam wanted to marry her, but she wasn't having any of it, unless they moved somewhere better. She also wasn't going to have any kids. So they moved to SA and had 4 kids!

## The Irish opportunity lost
One interesting story about my uncles down in Malinong was that our grand-mother's family, having started with about 12 children, had dwindled away due to not marrying, or moving overseas. 

In the end, there was noone who wanted to take on the family farm (a very small farm) and so they decided to offer it to one of my uncle's, probably Horace as he was the oldest son, but I can't be sure. 

He apparently made some comment like 'why would I want to go over there' before dismissing the idea out of hand.

He obviously hadn't seen the place, and probably had no idea what it was like. It is in County Cork, not far from Blarney Castle, and just gorgeous green country, with little streams running past and cute stone bridges. 

But he was probably right to reject it, as the farm would have been way too small to support any number of people, even though he never married. 

## The Chapman line
Similarly, Mum [Harriet May Chapman](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Chapman-6585) came from a farm 10k?? out of Dawson, which is 30k?? from Peterborough, close to  (but outside of!) [Goyder's Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goyder's_Line) which defined where the average rainfall became less than enough to support cropping. So, it was also not prime land. 

Quisque a orci sed lacus auctor viverra sed id mi. Aenean imperdiet nibh vitae maximus rhoncus. Curabitur ac ante congue sapien sagittis semper. Donec elementum, mauris sagittis pellentesque euismod, magna orci cursus sapien, sit amet pretium erat purus sed neque. 

Donec nec nulla eleifend, tincidunt orci in, lobortis nisl. Pellentesque suscipit quam ligula, vel imperdiet ipsum ultrices ut. Donec consequat suscipit nibh, eget varius urna suscipit et. Nam ullamcorper dolor ac tortor euismod, vitae euismod augue ultricies. Morbi laoreet eleifend lectus sed suscipit. 

Etiam eget elit at est vestibulum tempor at non nibh. Fusce eu lorem sem. Sed ut maximus nisl, non aliquet elit. Sed nec sapien erat. Mauris aliquet aliquet metus, dapibus molestie mauris dapibus sed. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos.

This reminds me more of a scene from the Irish famine than a farm in Australia, but it gives you a good idea of the conditions at the time. 

My Uncle Eric Chapman was the last relative on that farm. When Grandpa Chapman died (Grandma was already dead) Eric was bequeathed the farm, but he had to pay out the shared value to the other siblings. We have a letter in which Eric writes back to Mum, thanking her profusely for helping him out by returning her inheritance, as I'm sure he didn't have a lot of money and buying out the siblings would have been a challenge. Mum didn't have a lot either, but she obviously thought Eric deserved it more than she did. 

There are quite a few Chapman descendants spread around SA, NSW and Queensland that I know of. More detail on Wikitree. One thing you may not notice is that a lot of them were know by their middle name, not their first Christian Name. No idea why.
