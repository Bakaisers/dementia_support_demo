# Martial arts
I had an interest in martial arts from an early age, although information about them was quite limited (no Internet connection!)

Like a lot of things I look at now, I wish I had found out about, say, Aikido much earlier in life, as I'm sure it would have had a very beneficial effect on my outlook on life, and my confidence to do some things. But as they say "that's life".

## Kung Fu, the TV series
David Carradine starred in the Kung Fu series in the 70s. It was a 'must watch' for me, as he did all these amazing feats of martial arts. It would be interesting to go back and watch them now to see if I would still be impressed.
